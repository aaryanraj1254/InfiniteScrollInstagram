<script>
const showData = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        pageCount++;
        getPost();
    }, 300);
};

Delay: The setTimeout function introduces a small delay of 300 milliseconds before executing the code inside it.

Increment Page Count: pageCount++ increases the page number by 1, so the next batch of posts can be fetched.

Fetch More Posts: getPost() is called to fetch and display the next set of posts from the server.

In short, showData waits for 300 milliseconds, then increases the page number, and fetches more posts to display to avoid large api requests in short time.





******NOTE - 
data.forEach(currElm => {
data: This is an array of posts fetched from the API.

forEach: This is an array method that executes a provided function once for each array element.

currElm: This is a parameter representing the current element being processed in the array during each iteration.

If data is an array like this:
 id: 1, title: 'Post 1', body: 'This is the first post.' },
    { id: 2, title: 'Post 2', body: 'This is the second post.' }
]
The forEach method will:

Take the first element ({ id: 1, title: 'Post 1', body: 'This is the first post.' }) and execute the provided function with currElm set to this element.
Take the second element ({ id: 2, title: 'Post 2', body: 'This is the second post.' }) and execute the provided function with currElm set to this element.
In short, data.forEach(currElm => { ... }) processes each post in the data array one by one.

*****NOTE - 
container: This is the HTML element selected earlier with document.querySelector('.container'), where the posts will be displayed.


insertAdjacentHTML: This is a method that inserts the specified HTML content at a specified position relative to the container element.


'beforeend': This position specifies that the HTML content will be inserted at the end of 
the container, just before its closing tag.

htmlData: This is a string containing the HTML structure for a post, which was generated in the previous steps.


window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
    const { scrollHeight, scrollTop, clientHeight } = document.documentElement;

    if (scrollTop + clientHeight >= scrollHeight) {
        console.log('Reached the bottom of the page');
        showData();
    }
});


Listen for Scroll Events:

The code listens for when you scroll the page.
Get Scroll Positions:

It looks at three things:
scrollHeight: Total height of the page (content height).

scrollTop: How much you've scrolled down.
clientHeight: Height of the visible part of the page (the window).
Check If at Bottom:


It checks if you're at the bottom of the page.
This is true if scrollTop + clientHeight (how much you've scrolled plus the visible part) is greater than or equal to scrollHeight (total height of the page).

Load More Data:

If you're at the bottom, it logs a message ("Reached the bottom of the page") and calls showData() to load more posts.
When Will the Code Stop?

The code will continue to run and load more data as long as you scroll to the bottom of the page.

It will only stop if:
You stop scrolling.

There are no more posts to load from the server (if the API eventually has a limit or ends).

You leave the page or close the browser.
In summary, the code listens for when you scroll to the bottom of the page and then loads more posts, continuing to do this each time you reach the bottom.




**LINK - 
document.documentElement refers to the root element of the HTML document, which is usually the <html> element. It provides access to properties and methods that describe the entire HTML document.

In Simple Terms
document.documentElement is a way to get the top-level HTML element of the page.
It allows you to access and manipulate the entire document's structure and layout.
Example
When you use document.documentElement to get scrollHeight, scrollTop, and clientHeight, you're accessing the overall dimensions and scroll position of the entire webpage.

******NOTE - 
document.documentElement: This is a way to get the main part of your webpage (usually the <html> tag).
Why use it?: It helps you find out things like how tall your page is, how much you've scrolled down, and how big the visible area is.
Example




******NOTE - 
{postCount++}: This is a JavaScript template literal placeholder ${...} that evaluates the expression inside it.

postCount++: This is a post-increment operator. It increments postCount by 1 after its current value has been used.

How It Works
First Render: When this line is first processed, postCount starts from its initial value.

Insertion into HTML: ${postCount++} is replaced with the current value of postCount, and then postCount is incremented by 1.

Subsequent Renders: Each time this line is encountered again (if more posts are added), postCount will reflect its incremented value from the last insertion.

Example
Suppose postCount starts at 1:

First post: <p class="post-id">1</p> (postCount is incremented to 2)
Second post: <p class="post-id">2</p> (postCount is incremented to 3)
And so on, with each post getting a unique number.
<script>
Summary
${postCount++} dynamically inserts the current value of postCount into the HTML for each post, ensuring that each post has a sequentially increasing ID number (post-id).

******NOTE - when to fetch api
API Documentation: Look at documentation for available APIs. Websites like rapidapi.com or official documentation from service providers (like Twitter, Facebook, etc.) list APIs available for various purposes.


In your provided code example using jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, you fetched posts data (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts). You chose this API because it provides sample data (mock data) that's useful for testing and learning purposes.
